## Getting Started

# Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have:

Flutter installed (Flutter Installation Guide).
A suitable IDE (Android Studio, VS Code) with Flutter and Dart plugins.
Access to an API that supports CRUD operations for to-do items. If you're using a custom backend, set up the backend server before running the app.
